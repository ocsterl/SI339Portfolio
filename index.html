        <h2>Life in the Fast Lane</h2>
        <p> Founded in 1946 with the creation of the <a href="ttps://www.fia.com/">(FIA)</a>  Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile's (FIA), Formula 1 boasts some of the fastest cars in the world!</p>

        <h2>History of the Sport</h2>
	    <p>Formula 1 emerged in Europe after the end of the second Wold War. The term "Formula" in the name refers to a set of rules to which all participants and cars must comply. Initial races in the 1950s and 1960s were dominated by major pre-war manufactures such as Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Maserati and Mercedes Benz. Over the remainder of the 20th century, teams like McLaren and Williams joined the sport and joined a list of car "Constructors" dominating races.</p>

        <h2>Current State of the Sport</h2>
        <p>In the 2000s, Formula 1 has gained popularity beyond the European continent, hosting races in North America, South America, Austrailia, and Asia. There are 10 Teams that construct cars to race in 21 Grand Prix races across the globe. Each team employs two drivers, 20 drivers in total, who race to accumulate points for individual and team accolades. Drivers that finish in the top earn points, with the winner recieving 25 points and the points decreasing incrementally such that the 10th place finisher receives 1 point. At the end of the season, these points are tallied to determine the Constructor Champion (The team whose two drivers combined bring home the most amount of points.) and the Driver Champion (The individual driver who earns the most amount of points).</p>
